        Cities I want to visit 
    </p>
    <p>
        I didn't get to visit Australia when I was in the Navy even though I was stationed in the Pacific. And I grew up in the Cold War and I've always wanted to see the home of the evil empire that put the entire world in peril.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Sidney, Australia <span class="ingredient">- I want to see Sidney Harbor and the Opera House.</span></strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Moscow, Russia <span class="ingredient">- I want to see St Basil's Cathedral.</span></em>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>? (I want to visit countries, not specific cities) <span class="ingredient">- I want to visit the world's great religious landmarks and try to understand how such beauty can house such hate at times.</span></strong>
        </li>
