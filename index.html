        Working from the bottom up...my hometown, and then a list of cities I lived in as part of my Navy career. Davenport and Muscatine are the cities I lived in after leaving the Navy.

        Cities I want to visit 
    </p>
    <p>
        I didn't get to visit Australia when I was in the Navy even though I was stationed in the Pacific. And I grew up in the Cold War and I've always wanted to see the home of the evil empire that put the entire world in peril.
